## ⚡ About Firefly
**Firefly** is a clean and minimal theme for Obsidian, designed to offer a focused writing environment with subtle color accents.  
It supports both **dark and light modes**, and provides slightly different styles for **edit** and **preview** modes to enhance readability and UX.

The goal was to combine the feel of a code editor in editing mode with a more refined, blog-like feel in reading mode.

## 🤖 Special Theme Features

### 🏷 Code-Style Tags (CST)
Firefly introduces an experimental feature called **code-style tags** (CSTs), which allow you to style content blocks using custom labels.

**Usage:**  
Like code blocks, CSTs begin with triple backticks, but instead of a language, use a tag like `_note`.

#### Example: `_note` CST  
Wrap content like this:

    ```_note
    This is a note block.
    ```

In preview mode, this renders as a styled note box with a drop shadow and a red `#Note` label.

This is still experimental — feedback welcome!

## 📓 Typography
This theme uses the beautiful [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) fonts.  
For best results, install them locally on your system.
