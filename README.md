## ⚡️ About Firefly Theme

Firefly is a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The template provides a clean UI and decent color accents (for dark and light theme setup).

Firefly was created to add an Obsidian theme, that has more of the look and feel of a code editor in editor mode, and relies on more extended text formatting in preview mode, to deliver more of a blog ux there. 

### 🤖 Specific Theme Features

### Code-Style-Tags
In the Firefly theme it is possible to highlight certain content using certain tags (I'll just call them code-style- tags (cst)). At the moment this is only an idea, which I have implemented rudimentary for now - the usage is of course absolutely optional.

**cst are generated by double triple backticks (like code blocks)**, but instead of the programming language for syntax highlighting, a cst is written after the opening backticks. Cst's will always beginn with an underscore followed by a tag name such as e.g. `_note`, which will result in a specific style of the content written into the cst.

### _notes cst
Using the `_notes` cst, the content inside the tag is highlighted in preview mode as a "note box", which has a drop shadow and additionally marks the text with a red #Note text.

## 📓 Typography
This theme uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) fonts. For the best experience, I recommend installing these fonts onto your local machine.
