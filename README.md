# Firefly Obsidian Theme

![Release Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lazercaveman/firefly-obsidian-theme)

Firefly is a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The template provides a clean UI and decent color accents (for dark and light theme setup).

Firefly was created to add an Obsidian theme, that has more of the look and feel of a code editor in editor mode, and relies on more extended text formatting in preview mode, to deliver more of a blog ux there. 

## 📥  How-To Install the Firefly Theme into Obsidian

1. Open the Settings in Obsidian

## 📓 Typography
This theme uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) fonts. For the best experience, I recommend installing these fonts onto your local machine.

## 📦 About this Version
This is the first version of the Theme, and some stuff may not be implemented yet - it works for me for now. If you miss something feel free to get in touch or even participate if you like.
